              <p>This week we continued on our journey of javascript.We went deeper into the details of javascript basics. 
                We did alot of practice during the sessions. We basically covered;
                <ul>
                  <li>Functions</li>
                  <li> Arrays</li>
                  <li> DOM </li>
                  <li>And more of Github practice...</li>
                </ul>
                The take home exercises in this week were rather challenging for me because I really have problems with Arrays,but I was forced to practice them and I hope with more practice I will be able <br>to grasp the concept better.
