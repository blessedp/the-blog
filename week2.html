              <p>This week was basically the build up from the basics of the previous week.From our refresher/practice of HTML and CSS we were then introduced to javascript.We learned how to insert the 
                <i> <b>script tag</b></i> into an html tag.To do this we wrote our first javscript program and whie doing this got acquainted with the
                 <i><b>console.log</b></i> and played  around with the concept of <i><b>variables</b></i><br>
                 The highlight of this week durng the technical classes was the <strong><i>introduction of GITHUB and BOOTSTRAP</i></strong>
                 These made programming seem more achievable than ever before for me.During my practice with GITHUB, I learned how to
                 <ul>
                   <li> initialize a repository</li>
                   <li>add filesbe staged to  to a repository</li>
                   <li>push changes to the repository</li>
                   <li>commit those changes</li>
                  </ul>

                   Using bootstrap I was exposed to;
                   <ul>
                      <li> nav bar</li>
                      <li>div panels</li>
                      <li>use of different icons</li>
                      <li>different themes </li>
                     </ul>
                </p>
              <ul class="nav nav-pills">
                <li>
                    <a href ="index.html"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home" aria-hidden="true"> </span>Back to home page</a>
                </li>
                </ul>
          </div>
      </div>
